## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.

I developped the website while ensuring to incorporate key design elements requested by the client:

* A gallery showcasing the client's previous work and portfolio.
* An interactive price slider that works cross-browser.
* A fully responsive website that works on mobile devices as well.
* A contact form that would redirect user entries to the client's preferred email address.

I used HTML5 and CSS3 to optimize the pages content for accessibility and SEO. The main goal for the business was to convert clients into potential customers. Therefore accessibility and SEO were primordial to ensure high visiblity and usability of the site for search engines. To handle forms and manage form submissions, i used the "netlify forms" service, which allowed for serverless form handling.  

This project was an oppportunity to develop code management using version control in a more efficient manner. 

## Optimizations
List of things to be improved in the future for this project:

* Complete SEO optimization
* Redesign the pricing slider to be more accessible
* Compress images for faster download speeds and less data consumption


## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
